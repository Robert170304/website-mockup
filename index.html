            <h3 id="topic1">The Current Addiction Recovery Processes Don’t Always Work</h3>
            <p>There’s no program out there that’s:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Affordable</li>
                <li>Non-religious</li>
                <li>Completely judgment free</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Which is exactly why we’ve created <b>Can We Help Now</b>.</p>
            <p>What helped us get over our addictions was understanding the science behind why we get addicted, how our brains get affected, and how we can rewire our brains to stop repeating the addiction cycle.</p>
            <p>Even though some addiction programs want you to “admit” that you don’t have power, the reality is that:</p>
            <hr/>
            <h3 id="topic2">You are not Powerless</h3>
            <p>Yes, at times you might feel out of control, filled with regret, or like you want one thing or do another, but that doesn’t mean you are powerless.<br/><br/>
                It just means you don’t have the right tools to deal with what you’re facing right now. <br/><br/>
                It’s like trying to build a house when all you have is a guitar, a drum set, and a piano. <br/><br/>
                Sure, they sound beautiful and are great for building a band, but for building a house? Not so much.<br/><br/>
                But once you understand why your current behaviors and actions happen, have the tools to alter these actions and behaviors, and know how to use the tools and checklists to improve these behaviors... Your life will start to look very different.<br/><br/>
                And you don’t even have to leave your house to get these tools!
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <h3 id="topic3">Overcome Addiction From the Privacy of Your Own Home</h3>
            <p>We know first hand that there’s a stigma that comes with addiction.<br/><br/>
                There shouldn’t be. But there is.<br/><br/>
                And some people can have negative impacts on your journey to sobriety  and even make you question what you are doing.<br/><br/>
                That’s why we’ve created this program to be completely anonymous and self-paced.<br/><br/>
                You don’t have to tell your boss, your coworkers, or your friends you’re doing this. You can just get started and tell them when you’re ready - if ever!
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <h3 id="topic4">Your Roadmap to Getting Clean</h3>
            <p>It doesn’t matter whether it’s alcohol, drugs, pornography, or something completely different. They all have roots in the same chemical and physical processes in the brain.<br/><br/>
                And in this program we’ll show you how to help our brains dismantle these brain pathways that don’t serve us and how to create new, healthy pathways to improve your mental health, physical health, and your relationships without falling into those annoying shame & guilt cycles.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <h3 id="topic5">Here’s what the process looks like:</h3>
            <h4>Module One: Understanding Addictions and Addictive Behaviors</h4>
            <p>In this module you’ll learn exactly why addictions happen, get a concrete way of determining if you have an addiction, and get a better understanding of the process towards recovery.</p>
            <h4>Module Two: Understanding the Effects of Addictions and Addictive Behaviors</h4>
            <p>After completing this module you will understand the tricks, biases, and habits our brains use to trick us into repeating our addictive patterns. You’ll understand why those familiar shame and guilt cycles happen and how to break out of them. </p>
            <h4>Module Three: Tools To Kick The Habit</h4>
            <p>In this module you will learn the exact tools you need to kick the habit for good.</p>

                <img src="./markimg.png" alt="Mark Alton">
                <p>I was an expert at losing things because of my addictions. I lost my wife and I’ve experienced discrimination at work because of them. I’ve been through two treatment centers and have attended AA and SMART recovery meetings. I’ve been sober and I’ve relapsed, but it wasn’t until I understood what was scientifically happening in my brain that I finally felt in control and like I had a clear path to breaking free of my addiction.<br/><br/>
                As I went through my recovery process I realized I wasn’t a huge fan of the “give away control” and “admit you’re a terrible person” aspects of the recovery programs I was in... but when I looked for something different I saw there was no holistic program out there that was effective, based in science, and didn’t cost tens of thousands of dollars.<br/><br/>
                That’s when I knew that when I figured this out... I would create a program to help others tame their own addictions once and for all
                </p>

                <img src="./markimg.png" alt="Mark Alton">
                <p>My addictions took a different toll on my life. I was addicted before I met my wife and had kids, but when I was addicted I never noticed any effects on my family, my parents, or people I was friends with. Only after I got clean did I realize I hadn’t talked to my brother or sister in years.<br/><br/>
                    I had memory lapses that lasted for multiple days. I’ve woken up in different countries without realizing it, and I’ve lost track of time multiple times when I was addicted.<br/><br/>
                    But I knew I had to stop when I saw a video of myself and knew I never wanted my future kids to see me like that. I got clean ever since, but after meeting Mark I realized that everyone has a different journey to getting clean and I wanted to make this journey easier for other people.
